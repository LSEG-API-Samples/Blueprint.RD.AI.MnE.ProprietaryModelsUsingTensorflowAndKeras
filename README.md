# Modelling and Evaluation – Proprietary models using Tensorflow & Keras – Part I & II


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
While the out-of-the box structures provided from Tensorflow are more than enough to cover most of the AI scenarios, sometimes we need to implement a fully proprietary AI structure that solves a specific problem that is not supported. Tensorflow provides us with the tools to implement these kinds of structures allowing us to focus on building the core of the AI behaviour while still being able to leverage upon the very rich ecosystem of Tensorflow tools that can be used to train, monitor evaluate and productionise our solution.
